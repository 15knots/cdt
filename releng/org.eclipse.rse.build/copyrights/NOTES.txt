Standardizing Copyright Headers
-------------------------------
Some have "and others" on the Copyright line, others not.
Some like to indent their Contributors, others not.
Some have "All rights reserved." on the Copyright line, others below. STANDARD IS below
! MV is even missing the "All rights reserved." completely!
Some have a dot after "and others.", others not. -- STANDARD IS and others.
Some have a dot after "Inc", others not. -- STANDARD IS DOT
Some have a comma before ", Inc" others not. -- STANDARD IS COMMA
Some have trailing space, others not. -- STANDARD IS no trailing space
Some have an EPL Copyright, but formatted differently (in terms of line breaks)


AdvancedCopyrightTool:
Looks like it deletes all Contributors ?!?
Falls back to Eclipse/IBM Copyright if no exact match on 1st line
Matches the line with the ${date} only

234873 -- jun 18,08 -- extends
140936 -- dec 31,08 -- delete space


Take Care on HTML:
* about.html must not change date
* about.html has <blockquote>apache and stuff


Improvements:
* Fix insertion of space in IBM copyright
* Handle .html files (from docs)
* Allow fuzzy replacement of Copyright Year only
* Should we only act if it is EPL, i.e. not only company name but also license match?
MUST HAVE:
* It must be capable of adding "and others." if not already there. And do a corresponding fuzzy match.


IBM can standardize: "All rights reserved." on newline; always "And others."; 
- We have 818 where "All rights reserved." is on the Copyright line!
- In case of IBM, some have "and others.", some not.


Statistics:
- 818 with "All rights reserved." on first line - should always be 2nd!
- 730 of 2887 are non-IBM
- 269 (461) are also not "Wind River Systems, Inc. and others"
- 217 (52) are also not "Radoslav Gerganov" -- rse.wince
- 111 (106) are also not "Symbian Software Ltd" -- tm.discovery
- 105 (6) are also not "Celunite, Inc" -- services.telnet
- 72 (33) are also not "MontaVista Software, Inc"
- 26 (46) are also not "Wind River Systems, Inc"
- 24 (2) are also not "PalmSource, Inc" -- rse.services
- 9 (15) are also not "Takuya Miyamoto" -- rse.importexport
- rest are OK

Final Regex:
Copyright [(cC)]+ [0-9, -]+
Final filter:
IBM Corporation|Wind River Systems|Radoslav Gerganov|Symbian Software Ltd|Celunite, Inc|MontaVista Software, Inc|PalmSource, Inc|Takuya Miyamoto

What to do:
1. Fix the Wind River ones to be consistent
2. Advanced tool: dont match for "and others." but re-add it if it was not there. (Preference ?!?)
3. Advanced tool: if it is EPL and replacement takes place, insert standard EPL. (Preference ?!?)
4. Advanced tool: write documentation, and attach it to context help of Copyrights Tool Preference.
   (what it does, when if falls back etc)
3. What to do with diffs in punctuation -- "Inc" vs ", Inc" vs ", Inc."
