package org.eclipse.rse.core.references;

/**
 * Referenced objects are objects that have shadow objects of them.
 * Typically, shadows are created to enable a GUI which does not allow the same 
 * real object to appear multiple times. In these cases, a unique shadow object 
 * is created for each unique instance of the real object.
 * <p>
 * The parent interface IRSEReferencedObject captures the simple set of methods 
 * an object that supports such a shadow must implement.
 * <p>
 * This interface specializes that for the case of objects which support references 
 * that must be persisted.
 * Typically, we build the references in memory at runtime just to satisfy the GUI.
 * However, occassionally we build the list of references for a more permanent reason,
 * such as when we let a user choose a subset from a master list.
 * <p>
 * When we persist such a reference, we can't persist the memory reference to the master
 * object. Instead, we persist the unique name or key of that object, and upon restoring
 * from disk we then resolve that into a runtime reference to a real memory object.
 * <p>
 * This interface captures the method to allow a shadow or referencing object to
 * query that unique name or key from this referencable master object.
