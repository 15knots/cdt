/**
 * This interface represents a handle to a remote file system object,
 * which is either a file or a folder. This interface is similar to 
 * a java.io.File object, but with some significant differences:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This is an interface, so there are no static methods
 *   <li>This represents a "handle" to the remote file or folder. For editing purposes,
 *        you may want to manage a local copy of the remote file. The support
 *        for this is captured in the child interface IRemoteEditableFile
 *   <li>This are no action methods, only read methods. The action methods
 *        such as delete and rename are found in the file subsystem interface.
 *        All remote commands/actions are funnelled through subsystems in this
 *        remote system framework.
 *   <li>Similarly, the methods for listing objects are in IRemoteFileSubSystem, not here
 *   <li>Similarly, the methods for return an IRemoteFile object of the parent folder or
 *        root drive are in IRemoteFileSubSystem, not here.
 *   <li>Similarly, you do not construct these objects directly. Rather, there are
 *        factory methods in IRemoteFileSubSystem to create them.
 *   <li>There is no relative names. All names are fully qualified, and include
 *        the root, the path and the file name (unless this is a folder).
 *   <li>There are additional methods for querying the root (ie, c:\) and the
 *        parent directory (unqualified name of the parent directory).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note for subsystem providers: this method does not capture the set methods that the
 * RemoteFileImpl class defines. For that, cast to IRemoteFileMutable.
