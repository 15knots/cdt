Application programming interface for the RSE Base Shell and Terminal Services.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The RSE Terminal Services packages provides interfaces and basic utility classes
for shell or terminal connections. The classes in this package are especially designed
to be extendable by means of the <b>Decorator</b> pattern as well as the <b>Adapter</b>
pattern:
<ul>
<li><code><a href="ProcessBaseShell.html">ProcessBaseShell</a></code>
    is a sample class implementing IBaseShell, that wraps an existing
    <code><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html">java.lang.Process</a></code>
    object in the IBaseShell interface for easier consumption.</li>
</ul>
The classes and interfaces in this package are designed to have only minimal 
dependency into Eclipse core APIs, such that Services can eventually be re-used in
environments outside Eclipse. Especially 
<code><a href="IBaseShell.html">IBaseShell</a></code>, along with
<code><a href="ProcessBaseShell.html">ProcessBaseShell</a></code> and
<code><a href="BaseShellDecorator.html">BaseShellDecorator</a></code> are usable in
any environment, provided that mock objects are provided for Eclipse
IAdaptable and PlatformObject.
