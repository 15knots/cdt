The purpose of the org.eclipse.rse.tools.meta project is to be a collection point for scripts that
extract information from the workspace.

Each tool/script should be in its own folder. Results generated from that tool should be stored in the 
results subfolder of that folder. 

The working and results subfolders of a tool folder will not be synchronized.
